(b) Sri Lanka has one of the most advanced ancient irrigation systems in the world. Such an irrigation
system which supplies water for farmers and villagers consists of three major features as shown in
figure (1).
Feature 1: The tank or reservoir and the dam.
Feature 2 : The outgoing water canal from
the tank which is exposed to atmosphere.
Feature 3 : The Bisokotuwa (also known as Outgoing A W B

bricks (see figure (1)). When it is required to 2 012
release water from the tank, the water is first t
allowed to enter the Bisokotuwa in which the 2 D
speed of the water flow is drastically reduced.
Figure (1)
One reason for this reduction is the sudden increase in the cross-sectional area of the water flow within
the Bisokotuwa. In addition, a substantial amount of energy of the water flow is also lost, within the
Bisokotuwa, due to the collision of water with the stone walls of the Bisokotuwa.

06. Read the following passage and answer the questions.
Ocean waves are generally caused by wind and gravity. Wind-driven waves in the ocean, as well as tsunami
waves and tidal waves, are some examples of gravity waves. When wind blows across the surface of the
ocean, water surface of the ocean is continuously disturbed by the wind. Under this situation, the force
of gravity tries to restore the equilibrium at the interface between water and air. As a result, ocean waves
are created. Ocean waves can be categorized into two main types, namely deep-water waves and shallow-
water waves. The terms, shallow-water waves and deep-water waves have nothing to do with the true
depth of the ocean. The waves present in the ocean where the depth (h) of the ocean is greater than half
the wavelength (X), of the wave are called deep-water waves. When the depth (h) in the ocean is less than
half the wavelength (a), of the wave they are called shallow-water waves. The wavelengths of deep-water
waves are in the range of 1m -1km whereas the wavelengths of shallow-water waves are in the range of
10 km-500 km in the ocean. The value of the speed of propagation v of shallow-water waves in the ocean
of depth h is given by v=Vgh The average depth of the ocean is about 4 km.

Major tsunamis are caused by large-scale disturbances in the

occurring on or below the ocean floor, and impact of a large
meteorite with ocean. A tsunami is a series of ocean waves with Tsunami
very long wavelengths, ranging from 10 km-500 km in the wave
deep ocean. Even though the shape of a tsunami wave can be
- Ocean floor
approximated to a sinusoidal wave in the deep ocean far away
from the shore, it gradually takes a complex form as it reaches the

take a very complex shape near the shoreline as shown in figure 1(b),
and it may appear as a rapidly receding of the shoreline followed

by an incoming huge wave height grown up to several metres.
Figure 1 (b)
The rate of transfer of tsunami wave energy through the ocean
surface, which depends on both its wave speed and wave height,
r 10 m
remains nearly constant. In general, the value of the height He of the tsunami
wave as it enters shallow water is given by Hs= Halha/h)1/4, where Hd is wave
height in deep water, and he and hq are depths of the shallow and deep water
respectively.
When tsunami waves propagate across the ocean the wave crests can undergo
refraction. It is caused by segments of the wave moving at different speeds as the
water depth along the wave crest varies. In addition, due to uneven variation of
the ocean floor near the coast and obstacles such as small islands, reefs, etc., on the
tsunami path, these waves undergo interference and diffraction. The distribution
of tsunami wave heights was estimated by a group of scientists along the coastline
of Sri Lanka after the devastating tsunami that had occurred in December 26,
Figure (2)
2004. The length of the lines in figure (2) shows the heights of the tsunami wave
crests along the coastline. Superposition of waves from the primary source and reflected and diffracted
waves from obstacles was responsible for the erratic pattern of the wave heights and the varying damage
along the coastline.
(a) Explain briefly how the ocean waves are created by wind and gravity.
(b) What is the difference between deep-water waves and shallow-water waves exist in the ocean?
(c) What are the three causes of tsunami wave formation mentioned in the passage?
(d) Identify the type of the tsunami waves possible in ocean (deep-water waves or shallow-water waves),
and estimate the speed of tsunami waves in ms-l in the ocean having an average depth of 4 km.
(e) The height of tsunami wave rapidly increases as it approaches shallow water near the coast. Explain
qualitatively why this happens.
(f) Calculate the height of the tsunami wave in the ocean at a place where the water depth is 6250 m. Take
the height of the wave at a water depth of 10 m as 5 m. Considering the wavelength of tsunami, explain
why it is difficult to detect tsunami waves in the deep ocean.
(g) Assuming that a tsunami wave takes the shape shown in figure (1) (b) at the shoreline , explain briefly
why the shoreline recedes from the land just before the arrival of the huge mass of water. .

07.(a) Concrete is a hardened mixture of cement, sand, gravel and water. Reinforced concrete structures are
structures composed of concrete and steel bars. All rigid bodies, such as steel and concrete are elastic
to some extent. Concrete is strong under compression but weak under extension while steel is strong
under both situations. As a combination, concrete mainly resists compression, and steel bars mainly
sustain the tension.
Consider a plain concrete beam having rectangular cross-section, and Concrete beam
without steel bars, kept on two supports, and subjected to a load W
as shown in figure 1(a). Under this situation, the bottom part of the
beam will experience an extension while the top part will experience a
compression as shown with dotted lines.

(i) Which side of the plain concrete beam (top or bottom) is most
vulnerable to crack under the load W?
(ii) To improve the situation shown in figure 1(a), steel bars are inserted
closer to the bottom of the concrete beam at the production stage as
1 Steel bars
shown in figurel(b). Based on the information given at the beginning
of the question, explain, how this improves the load bearing capacity Figure 1(b)
and prevents cracking of the concrete beam.
(b) The tensile stress E). - strain (6) relationship for mild steel (S) can be modelled, as shown in figure 2(a).
Even though concrete is a brittle material, the tensile stress
strain relationship of the
concrete (C) under tensile force can also be modelled as shown in figure 2(b). In reinforced concrete,
steel bars are well bonded to concrete, thus they can jointly resist external loads together until concrete
cracks.

10. Answer either part (A) or part (B) only.
(A) Frying is a food processing technique which involves the use of hot oil as heating medium to prepare
food. If the frying is done using a large quantity of oil with respect to the quantity of food material to be
fried, then it is called deep frying. If it is done with a relatively smaller quantity of oil it is called stir-frying.
Generally, deep frying takes place in the temperature range of 190°C – 140°C and the stir-frying in the
temperature range of 115°C – 100°C. Deep frying is expensive, as a large quantity of oil has to be replaced
regularly, however, in most of the cases deep frying yields tastier food.
Results of an investigation conducted by a student in an attempt to achieve higher temperatures by using
a small quantity of oil is given below. To increase the heat capacity of the system and there by to achieve
higher temperatures, he has used small reusable solid porcelain spheres mixed with a relatively small
quantity of oil.
(a) As the first step, the student poured 0.2 kg of oil into a suitable pot having outer walls covered with
an insulating material, and heated upto 200 °C using a small immersion heater. The heater was then
removed and 0.2 kg of dry food material was added instantly and mixed with the oil. If the specific heat
capacities of the oil and the food material are 1650 J kg-1 °C -1 and 1600J kg-1 °C-1 respectively, and the
initial temperature of food material is 30°C, calculate the final temperature of the mixture. Assume
that the heat capacity of the empty pot is negligible compared with that of oil, and the heat loss to
surrounding is also negligible.
(b) Student then emptied the pot and added the same amount (0.2
kg) of fresh oil as in (a) above and also a certain amount of small
solid uniform porcelain spheres. Assume that the added spheres sild
Procelair
get packed, in the regular manner (regular packing) as shown in
og spheres
figure (1). The spheres were added to the pot in such a way that oooooo
the space of the voids created by the spheres when get packed
Voids occupy half the
occupies half the volume of oil in the pot (see figure (1)).
volume of oil
Figure (1)
(i) As the spheres are packed in the regular manner, considering Unit
Unit
unit cubes occupied by spheres as shown in figure (2), show that
the total volume of spheres is equal to the volume of oil containing
cybe
in the voids. (Take n = 3.)
000000000
DO000000
(ü) If the densities of the oil and porcelain are 900 kg m-3 and 2500 kg m-3 m m
respectively, calculate the mass of the porcelain spheres.
Figure (2)
(iii) The student then heated the pot containing oil together with the porcelain spheres upto 200°C,
and again added and mixed the same amount (0.2 kg) of the same food material at 30°C, as in (a)
above. If the Specific heat capacity of porcelain is 1000 J kg-1 °C-1, calculate the final temperature of
the mixture. Neglect the heat capacity of the empty pot and the heat loss to surrounding.
(c) What is the advantage if smaller porcelain spheres than those used in the above investigation are used?

Light beam
to carry out the photoelectric effect experiment.
(i) The part marked as D is a voltage supply. What are the two main
features, D should have in order to obtain photoelectric current (1) -
potential difference (V) characteristic?
(ii) Name the parts labelled as A and B.

(iii) Two monochromatic light beams, green (wavelength 1,) and red
Figure (1)
[wavelength 1, (>1o) I colours with same intensities measured in W m²,
are allowed to incident on A, one beam at a time. The frequencies of the
light beams are higher than the threshold frequency of the material made of A.
(1) Draw a rough sketch to indicate the variation of I with V, for both green and red colours in the
same graph. The curves for green and red colours should be clearly labelled as Gand R respectively.
Assume that same percentage of incident green and red colour photons emit photoelectrons
(2) If the difference between the stopping potentials is AV, and the difference between the
frequencies is Af for green and red colours, obtain an expression for the ratio Af / AV in
terms of Planck's constant h and magnitude of the electronic charge e using the Einstein's
photoelectric effect equation.
(b) A certain photoelectric smoke alarm sy_tem mainly consists
T-shaped
of a T-shaped chamber fitted with a monochromatic light
chamber
emitting diode (LED), a photocathode and an electronic
alarm as shown in figure 2(a).
LED
Photocathode
Under the normal smoke-free condition, the photons of the
- Electornic
LED light beam travel through the chamber and move away
alarm
without striking the photocathode as shown in figure 2(a).
When smoke enters the chamber, some of the photons collide
Figure 2 (a)
with the smoke particles and move in different directions without change in their wavelength as shown
in figure 2(b).
The number of photons thus collides is proportional to the number of smoke particles present in the
chamber. Out of the collided photons, a certain number is incident on the photocathode and generates
a small photoelectric current. When a sufficient number of photons is incident on the photocathode
it generates an adequate current to activate the electronic
alarm.
_Smoke in
(i) If the wavelength of the photons emitted by the LED
is 825 nm, calculate the energy of a photon in eV.
Take h = 6.6 x 10-34 J s, speed of light in vacuum
c=3 x108 m s-1 and leV=1.6 x 10-19 J.
Figure 2(b) 40
(ii) Two photocathodes X and Y, made of materials with
work functions 1.4eV and 1.6eV respectively, are available to you. Which photocathode (X or Y)
is suitable to construct a smoke alarm system with the LED mentioned in (b)(i) above? Justify
your answer.
(iii) Power of the LED is 10 mW. If only 3% of energy goes into produce light of wavelength of 825 nm,
calculate the number of photons emitted by the LED per second.
(iv) Photocathode should receive at least 20% of the emitted photons per second from the LED to
activate the alarm. Calculate the minimum number of photons per second that should be incident
on the photocathode to activate the alarm.
(v) When photons are incident on the photocathode, only a part of the incident photons contributes to
the emission of photoelectrons. Assuming that only 10% of incident photons emits photoelectrons,
calculate the minimum photoelectric current that should be generated by the photocathode to
activate the alarm. Take e = 1.6 x 10-19 C.

Instability of soil that occurs due to the infrastructure developments grains
such as road constructions in mountain regions without proper
study, can create problems such as sinking roads and landslides.
Landslides are now a common tragedy in many parts of the country
during rainy seasons. The stability of sand, a constituent of soil,
heavily depends on the amount of water present in the sand. Anyone
who has built structures such as 'sandcastles' using wet sand knows
Figure 1 (a)
upper
that the adhesive properties of wet and dry sand are very different.
meniscus
Wet sand can be used to build sharp-featured sandcastles whereas
dry sand just crumbles down in this process. Some of the aspects of lower
these phenomena related to the stability of soil or sand can be explained meniscus
by fundamental physics concepts such as gravity, friction and surface
Figure 1 (b) Figure (2)
tension.
Soil is generally a porous medium comprising a mixture of mineral particles such as clay, silt and sand of different
sizes, and voids. Voids are filled with either air or water as shown in figure 1(a). The porous nature of soil can create
practical problems, such as sinking of heavy structures on the ground. This occurs due to the compression of voids
caused by the heavy loads on the ground. Leaning of Pisa tower and sinking of the Meethotamulla dump site and the
earth in the vicinity of the Uma Oya tunnel are a few examples. Another important parameter which determines the
stability of soil (or sand) is the angle of repose. When a bucket of dry soil is emptied on to a hard levelled floor the
soil particles slide easily and form a conical pile due to the friction between grains as shown in figure (2). The angle
a of the pile is known as the angle of repose which is the steepest stable slope that a particular substance can form.
Removal of soil from the base of a slope, increasing the angle of repose, can create instability on the slope.
Sand in soil can be considered as a porous medium. It consists of a system of randomly oriented complex capillary
tubes of different sizes similar to the structure shown in figure. 1(a). Capillary forces draw water into the sand changing
the physical properties of sand medium. Damp sand forms capillary water bridges between its grains (see figure 1(a))
Nanometer- scale water bridges between millimeter-scale grains dramatically increase the attraction between grains.
It is due to the adhesive forces associated with the water bridges between grains. Dry sand grains maintain stability
due to frictional forces, and in addition wet sand grains attract each other due to adhesive forces. The enhancement of
the attraction of the grains due to these capillary forces leads to the increase of the repose angle creating sand clumps.
The surface of a water bridge is concave (figure 1(b)), and so generates' capillary action' which helps to hold the sand
grains firmly together due to surface tension.
During rainy season the soil saturated with water creates high pressure on the voids and grains. Gradually increasing
the pressure inside voids increases the curvature of the surface of water bridges decreasing the capillary force between
the grains. The addition of more water to the soil can decrease friction and strength between the grains, and increase
the weight of the soil making an ideal situation for landslides. Damage on the Earth's soil surface due to the addition of
large amounts of pesticides and fertilizers decreasing the surface tension force between the grains can also dramatically
increase the likelihood of a landslide.

08. Read the following passage and answer the questions.
Induction heating technology is of choice in many industrial, domestic and medical applications due to advantage
such as less heating time, localized heating, direct heating and efficient energy consumption. The operating principle
of induction heating is based on the law of the electromagnetic induction discovered by Michal Faraday in 1831. The
two major components in an induction heating system are a coil of wire (often a copper coil ) producing a time
varying magnetic field upon receiving a high frequency alternating current and an electrically conducting material
that generates heat. The magnetic filed also change its direction as the direction of the alternating current changes.
When a conducting material is exposed to such a time - varying magnetic field, current loops called eddy currents
are induced in the conducting material. As the magnetic field changes its direction rapidly the eddy currents also
change their directions rapidly. The eddy currents always form closed loops inside conducting materials in planes
perpendicular to the varying magnetic field. Eddy currents, generate Joule heat (FR type heat) due to the existence of
resistance of the material.
When the magnetic field created is stronger or when the electrical conductivity is higher or when the rate of change of
magnetic field is larger,the eddy currents that are developed become larger. 'The eddy currents is which are generated
by high frequency alternating current in the coil will exist only within a limited thickness near the surface of the
material due to what is called skin effect.
The skin effects is the tendency of any high frequency electric current to distribute itself in a conductor with the
curent density being largest near the surface of the conductor and decreasing very rapidly with the depth of the
conductor. This thickness across which eddy currents are distributed becomes even smaller due the mutual attraction
between the alternating current in the coil and eddy current loops. This is called the proximity effect. In addition
to the Joule heating, an additional heat is also produced within the material due to a phenomenon called hysteresis
effect. It occurs only in ferromagnetic materials such as some stainless steel, cast iron, nickel, etc. In response to the
varying magnetic filed produced by the alternating current, the magnetic domains in these materials repeatedly
change their orientations. The energy required to turn them around finally is converted to heat. The rate at which the
heat is generated due to hysteresis effect increases with the frequency of the varying magnetic field. Commercially
available induction heating systems operate at frequencies approximately from 60 Hz to about 1 MHz and deliver
power in the from a few watts to several Megawatts.
The cookers that are available in the marked as induction cookers operate on this principle. In an induction cooker,
a coil of copper wire is mounted just under the surface of the cooker top where the cooking pot is placed, Without

touching it, and an alternating electric current is sent through the coil. The entire bottom of the cooking pot itself acts
as the conducting material that generates the heat. The varying magnetic filed produced by the coil enters the bottom
of the cooking pot creating eddy currents and hysteresis losses, generating heat. In order to make use of both effects
for heat generation, the cooking post or the bottoms of the cooking pots are made of ferromagnetic materials such as
some stainless steel or cast iron.

If the flux density B of the applied magnetic filed varies sinusoidally as B= B, sin wt where B, is the amplitude of
the flux density of the magnetic filed, w is the angular frequency and t is the time, then based on a very simplified
model the average power P generated by the eddy currents in the disk can be given by

in series with electrical/electronic circuits to avoid damages caused to them due to the passage Fuse wire

and short circuits) When the current through the fuse in a certain circuit becomes larger than
the recommended current in the circuit, the fuse burns (melts) and disconnects the circuit

recommended currents in the circuits.

f= 33.75 cm
(d) Additional corrective lens should be a converging lens.
Reason:
The image formed by the eye lens should be moved forward to coincide with the retina OR
When the eye lens gets weaker the image of an object at the normal near point will be formed behind the retina.
Therefore, light passing through the lens has to be converged to the retina.

(iii) According to the Lenz's law, the induced current and induced emf in ,a conductor are in such a direction as to
set up a magnetic field that opposes the change in the magnetic field that produced them.
The magnetic field produced by the coil is increasing in the upward direction therefore to oppose this magnetic
field the induced eddy current should be in the opposite direction of the current in the coil
(8) The increase of the frequency of alternating current increase the rate of change, of magnetic flux in the conducting

Increase in the rate of change of magnetic flux increases the magnitude of eddy current in the material.

% The fuse will burn before one millisecond
(v) No
Justification:
Energy needed to melt the fuse wire = mcAO
= (7.5x10-) 390 x 1050
= 3.07J
Energy dissipated in the fuse = 5002 x (1.7x10-2) 5 x 10-6 = 2.125 x 1025
This value is very much less than the energy needed (3.07 J) to melt the wire. Therefore, the fuse will not melt

Alternative method :
If AO is the increase in temperature of the fuse,

(2) Peak voltage of the waveform in c(i) is (+)15V, but the peak voltage of the waveform in c(ii) is + 4.7V.
Reasons :
(1) The diode is reversed biased during negative half cycles of the waveform, and does not allow the negative half
cycle of the waveform to pass through. No current will pass through when it is in reversed biased.
(2) Zener diode will limit the peak voltage of the output waveform in c (ii) to 4.7 V

The detector system consists of a source diode and a detector diode. Source diode, emits a narrow beam of Infra-Red
(IR) light with a constant intensity of I,. This light beam is detected by the detector diode, and it also measures the
intensity of the beam (see figure (2)(a)). Detector system is placed in the path of the bob of the simple pendulum.
While oscillating, the bob also crosses the IR beam (see figure (2)(b)). Whenever the bob interrupts the IR beam, the
detector diode signal becomes zero, otherwise it produces a signal of constant intensity 1. When the bob is oscillating,
the computer monitor displays a graph of the variation of the detector signal intensity (1) With time (t).

Read the following passage and answer the questions
Earthquakes are one of the powerful natural phenomena on earth. The internal structure of Tectonic Plates
the earth is one of the important parameters needed to understand the major seismic activities crust ima ge!
sphere
around the globe. The earth may be considered to have three major concentric parts, namely
the crust, the mantle and the core (see figure (1)). The lithosphere and asthenosphere are the
two outer layers of the earth. The lithosphere consists of 10 major rigid lithospheric plates called
tectonic plates which are considered to be floating on the asthenosphere. Heat is transferred
towards asthenosphere due to the high temperature in the core. The convection currents thus
produced in the asthenosphere cause the movements of tectonic plates. When two tectonic
plates move with respect to each other, friction sometimes causes two plates to get stuck. when
figure (1)
this happens elastic strain energy builds up, until eventually the plates given way creating an
earthquake. This stored energy is released creating energetic waves called seismic waves . these seismic waves travel in
all directions from the point where the energy is released, and this point is known as the focus of the earthquake. The
corresponding point on the Earth's surface, directly above the focus, is called epicentre of the earthquake.
The earth's crust supports propagation of travelling waves. The waves which travel
Amplitude (mm)-250
through the crust are called body waves and those travel on the surface are called surface
waves. The body waves consist of P (primary) waves and S(secondary) waves. P waves are
longitudinal whereas the S waves are transverse. Since any material, solid or fluid, can be
subjected to compression ,the P waves can travel through any kind of material however
,S waves which depend upon shear force ,do not exits in a fluid. The absence of S waves
at large distances from an earthquake was the first indication that the Earth has a liquid
region also. The P waves from an earthquake arrive at a given location before the Swaves
and surface waves.
figure (2)
There is a large number of seismic data recording stations throughout the world. In order to find the distance d from such
a station to the epicentre, one needs to measure the difference in arrival times At of Pand S waves to the station (see figure (2)).

be found using the d values from at least three recording stations. By drawing three circles
with radii corresponding to the distances (d values) measured, and using the common
point of intersection of the circles (triangulation), one can find the location of the epicentre. 700
Richter scale is the most accepted method used to estimate the strength of an earthquake.
Distance d of the epicentre from the station and the maximum amplitude A of the seismic 600
waves recorded at the station can be used to estimate the Richter scale magnitude M of an
earthquake using the nomogram shown in figure (3). the magnitude M of an earthquake is dikm;

(i) Where does the given charge of the wire physically reside?
(ii) considering an appopriate Gaussian surface around the wire, show that the magnitude of the intensity of the electric
field E at a distance r(2 a) from the axis of the wire is given by E = where ε, is the permittivity of free space.

In this arrangement the wire A is connected to a positive potential with respect to the ground, and can be
considered as an anode.
(1) Copy the anode and the equipotential lines to the answer script and draw the electric field lines from the
positions marked with dots on the equipotential line e up to the anode wire A.
(2) calculate the intensity of the electric field E, between two equipotential lines.
(b) Part of an arrangement used for the detection of high energy particles and photons is similar to the one described
in part (a)(v) above. Suppose that such an arrangement with an anode A having a charge per unit length. +1 = 8.1 x
* 10-8 C m is housed in a chamber filled with an inert gas (Argon) at atmospheric pressure.
Consider a situation in which a photon enters the chamber and collides with an atom at X creating a photoelectron
and an argon ion. Such an electron is called a primary electron. The energy needed to create one such electron-ion a
pair in argon gas is 30 eV. (1 eV = 1.6 x 10-19 J, charge of an electron e = 1.6 x 10-19 C)
(i) write down an expression for the magnitude of the initial acceleration of the primary photoelectron due to the
electric field mentioned in (a)(v)(1) above in terms of m, e and Ey, where mand e are the mass and charge of an
electron respectively.
(ii) Explain, why the electron moves towards anode A with a drift velocity v, without accelerating continuously.
(iii)suppose that the primary electron which started from rest is moving along the electric field mentioned in (a)(v)
(1) above. If the average distance moved by the primary electron between two successive collisions with argon
atoms is 0.5um, calculate the increase in kinetic energy of the primary electron between two collision in eV
due to the electric field between two collisions, and show that the primary electron having this energy is unable
to remove another electron upon colliding with another argon atom.(Consider that the energy required for an
electron to remove an electron from an argon atom is 30 eV).
(iv) when this primary electron is closer to the anode it experiences a high electric field given by the expression
stated in (a)(ii) above. Under this condition ,the primary electron gains sufficient energy between collisions to
create electron-ion pairs and the secondary electrons produced in this manner in turn create more electron-ion
pairs before getting collected at the anode. Total number of secondary electron produced by a single primary
electron in this manner is called the amplification factor for the gas. Ability to collect charges by the anode wire
indicates that it has the property of capacitance. This capacitang is called the detector capacitance. When the
charges are collected by the anode, a small voltage is generated across this capacitor. If the detector capacitance
is 5pF and the voltage generated across this capacitor due to secondary electrons produced by the primary
electron is 0.96. mV find the charge collected by the anode.
(v) hence find the amplification factor for the gas,

Alternative Answer (1)
Additional power required to maintain the speed at 126 km h (35m s-1)
= (0.2)x (2m2) x(1.3kg m’) x[35m s 1)3-(25 m s-1)}] = 14170 W
Alternative Answer (2)
Power is proportional to v’and other power requirements remain constant.
Additional power required to maintain at 126 km h (35 m s')

When V = 0.7 V, this voltage is sufficient to make the base-emitter junction of the transistor forward biased and
therefore the transistor does not operate as an open switch.
(iv) In order to operate the combined circuit as a NAND gate the transistor should operate as an open switch when
A #1 and / or B # 1. so its output is 1 under such situations. This can be done by introducing another diode in

(a) When a person is changing steps while
walking, at one instant the entire body
weight of the person is borne only by a single
leg as shown in figure (1). Front view of the
relevant bone structure of this leg is shown in
figure (2), and the corresponding simplified
free-body diagram indicating all the forces
acting on the leg is shown in figure (3). All the
forces indicated in figure (3) and the weight Figure (1)

this situation.
Here,

(b) When a person with an injured
hip joint is walking, he tends
to limp by leaning towards the
injured side as he steps on the
foot attached to the injured
joint (see figure (4)]. As a result,
the centre of gravity of the body
shifts to the side of injured hip
joint and Fy acts in the vertical upward
direction. The free body diagram for the nitro.com
leg for this case is shown in figure (5) and corresponding
forces of F, and F, are indicated as F and F, , respectively.

(i) Find the force F, for this situation, in terms of W.
(ii) Calculate, as a percentage, the reduction in the
magnitude of force F, as a result of the limping of
the person for the reason described in (b) above.
(c) In the process of walking, while one leg rests on the
ground the other leg moves around the hip joint. This
motion can be considered as an oscillatory motion of
a rod which is freely pivoted at one end as shown in
figure (6). Here the leg is considered as a uniform rod
of length l.

of rotation through the point Q, obtain an expression
for the angular acceleration a, in terms of 1, 0, W, and
I, for the position indicated in figure (6).

(a) Draw in four separate diagrams the standing wave
patterns of fundamental mode and first three overtones
produced by a tube of length L open at both ends.
Mark nodes as N and anti nodes as A in the diagram
corresponding to the fundamental mode. Obtain
expressions for frequencies f of these waves in terms »
of L and the speed of sound v, inside the tube. Neglect
end corrections.
b) Figure 1(a) shows a standard 6 hole-flute. According to
a simple model, this flute can be considered equivalent
to a set of tubes open at both ends. Figure 1(b) shows
the corresponding effective lengths of open tubes
equivalent to the flute.

When all the holes of the flute are opened it is equivalent
to an open tube of length L, as shown in figure (2). When
the first hole of the flute is closed the equivalent length of
the tube becomes L, and when the first 2 holes are closed
at the same time the equivalent length becomes L, and so
on (see figure (2)].

corresponding fundamental frequencies. The speed of
sound in the tube is 340 ms?. Calculate the effective
lengths L. and L
(c) Certain flutes have a few small holes in addition to the
standard holes. Such a small hole, when open, will
produce an anti node at the location of that hole in
the flute. Having such a small hole in the flute will not
alter the effective length of the equivalent open tube,
but produces an anti node at an appropriate location in
the equivalent tube thereby modifying the wave pattern
accordingly and produces a standing wave. If such an
open small hole on the flute produces an anti node
at the centre of the equivalent open tube of length La
when all other holes are closed, draw the first two new
standing wave patterns produced in the tube and obtain
expressions for their frequencies f in terms of v and La
(d) (i) Write down the frequencies of first four standing
wave patterns in part (c) in terms of v and Lo.
(ii) Assuming that the length L, is equal to the length L
of the open tube mentioned in (a) above, compare
the frequencies that you obtain in (d)(i) with the
frequencies obtained in part (a), and thereby
comment on the effect of having a small hole as
mentioned in part (c).
(e) An anti node is produced at a distance of 3/2 L, in the
equivalent open tube due to an open small hole located
at the left of the first standard hole of the flute as shown
in figure (3). Draw the wave pattern of the first standing
wave in the equivalent open tube (corresponding to the
lowest frequency) and calculate its frequency, when the
flute is played with the small hole opened.

Read the passage below and answer the questions given.
The magnitude of the contact angle of water depends
on the nature of the surface with which water is in contact.
Water drops can settle on certain ideally flat surfaces so that
the angle of contact is less than 90°. Such a surface is known
Astan Publications
G.C.E. Advanced Level - Physics 2014 11
to have been wetted by water and acts as a hydrophilic
surface. However, some surfaces consisting of rough
structure at micro/nano scale can act as hydrophobic
surfaces showing non-wetting properties.

The lotus leaf, compared to other natural leaves,
shows superhydrophobic properties with a contact angle of
water greater than 150° and remains clean in muddy, dirty
ponds and tanks. When rain drops fall on the surfaces of
lotus leaves, instead of wetting the leaf, they immediately
bead up like shiny spherical balls and roll off the surface
even at the slightest disturbance. Collecting dirt and debris
away. This water repellent self cleaning property of lotus leaf
is known as the “lotus effect
The lotus effect arises due to the dual scale micro/
nano structures present in the lotus leaf. Covering its surface,
the lotus leaf has a series of protrusions (parts that stick out
like bumps) called papillae that are nearly 10 um in height.
Each papilla is covered with a nano-metre scale thick super
hydrophobic waxy layer. The roughness introduced by
papillae allows air to be trapped under water drops as shown
in figure (1) contributing to the non-wetting behaviour of
the leaf. Using the lotus effect, a variety of surfaces has been
patterned to produce roughened hydrophobic surfaces with
high contact angles of water necessary for water repellent
window glasses, self cleaning clothes and paints, and low-drag
(show low resistance by water against motion) marine vessels,
etc.
Wettability of a surface also depends on the nature
of the liquid. Some liquids wet roughened surfaces whereas,
some liquids show non-wetting properties. Property of
wetting of roughened surfaces by liquids is used to fabricate
nano-structures such as nanotubes and nanorods by means
of the technique known as 'template wetting nano fabrication
This technique uses a solid template that contains an array of
nanopores as shown in figure (2).
A non-wetting liquid does not penetrate the pores
and settles on the protrusions of the template whereas, a
wetting liquid penetrates into pores by wetting walls and
filling the pores. When nanopores are filled with a wetting
solvent that contains a desired solid and the template is
heated, due to evaporation of the solvent, the- solid is left
behind on the pore walls or in the nanopores as shown in
figures 3(a) and 3(b) respectively. Removal of pore walls
of the template by a chemical treatment known as etching
will leave behind structures with nano-tubes or nanorods
as shown in figures 3(c) and 3(d), respectively.
(a) Write down three applications of artificially fabricated
hydrophobic surfaces.
(b) How does the lotus effect help to remove dirt from the
surface of a lotus leaf?
— Phy/AL/2014/11
G.C.E. Advanced Level - Physics 2014
(c) How do you categories hydrophilic, hydrophobic and
super hydrophobic surfaces in terms of the contact
angle of water?
(d) Show using a diagram how a wetting liquid and a non-
wetting liquid settles on an ideally flat solid surface .
(e) By copying the rough surface in figure (2) draw
diagrams to show how a wetting liquid and non-
wetting liquid settles on it.
(f) When dew begins to form, do you expect water
molecules to condense in the pores on the surface of a
lotus leaf? Give reasons for your answer.
(g) State the effect of employing roughened hydrophobic
surfaces on low-drag marine vessels.
(h) Mention two nano-structures that can be fabricated
using the technique 'template wetting nano fabrication
(i) Consider a parallel gold plate capacitor having plates
consisting of gold nanorods of diameter of 100 nm
and height of 50 um with 1013 nanorods per square
meter. Assuming that the capacitance of this capacitor
increases due to the increase in the effective surface
area, calculate by what factor would the capacitance
increase compared to a gold plate capacitor without
nanorods, but has identical dimensions. Assume
that the separation between capacitor plates is much
greater than the height of a nanorod.

Assume that the electric field is confined only to the
space between the two electrodes.
(ii) Once the accumulation of the ions on the electrode
has begun, the path for the ions entering the field
region is not a part of a circle. What is the reason for
this?
(iii) After a certain period of time has elapsed, the ions
entering the field region tends to travel along a
straight line without deviation. If V is the voltage
across the electrodes once this state (steady state) has
been reached, obtain an expression for v in terms
of V., B and d.

electrodes are placed touching the walls of the artery as
shown in figure(3) and blood flow speed is determined
by measuring the voltage across electrodes at the steady

(i) If the flux density of the applied magnetic field at
a certain location X of an artery is B, = 0.08 T and
the measured voltage across the electrodes at X is VX

at X using the expression obtained in (c) (ii). The
internal diameter of the artery at X is, dx=3 x 10-m.
(ii) In order to investigate the possible change in
diameter of the artery at another location Y, a
similar device is placed at Y. When the magnetic
field applied at Y is set to B,= 0.05 T, the measured
voltage across the electrodes at Y is V = 1.80 x 10-4

(iii) If R = 5 kN, calculate the minimum value of R,
which will permit only up to a 1 % of variation in
the current I of the circuit when slider W is moved
from A to B.
(b) Terminals 1-9 of the potential divider shown in figure (2)
are used to provide currents to 9 electrodes (not shown
in the figure) of a certain device. Values of the resistors
R., R, and R, are selected so that when electrodes are not
connected to the potential divider, and a voltage (V.) is
applied to the potential divider, the voltage appearing
across the resistor R, is 4 times that appearing across each
and every R, resistor, and the voltage appearing across R,
is 3 times that across R.
(i) If V = 1500 V and the current V=+ 1500 V
through the potential divider is 1
mA, calculate R,, R, and R.
(ii) Consider a situation where
only terminal 9 has to provide a
current of 5 uA for a period of 1
us to the electrode to which it is
connected. Calculate the voltage
drop appearing across R, during
this period due to the supply of the
above current from the potential
divider. Assume that the current
through the potential divider from
terminal 1 to terminal 9 remains
unchanged at 1 mA.
(iii)In situations where currents are
drawn for short periods of time
as in (b)(ii), the drop created in
terminal voltage can be minimized Figure (2)

the charges stored in the capacitor
connected across R, as shown in
figure (3).

AV across the capacitor in terms of AQ and C.

(A)
Figure 1 (a) shows a parabolic disc & cavity receiver
type solar energy collector having
a circular åperture which extracts
and converts solar energy to heat.
Solar energy flux is concentrated
to a cavity receiver placed at the Figure 1(a) Figure 1(b)
focus of the parabolic disc as shown in figure 1(a). An oil
passing continuously through a spiralled metal tube fixed
to the inner wall of the cavity extracts the heat absorbed
by the cavity. Parabolic disc is moved so that the solar flux
always falls normal to the disc as shown in figure 1(b).
Aperture diameter, d of the disc is 20 m and the intensity
of the solar flux striking the earth surface is 1000 Wm?.
(a) Calculate the rate at which solar energy is incident on
the parabolic disc (Take n = 3).
(6) Assuming that sunshine is available for 6 hours a day
and 60% of the incident solar energy is absorbed by the
oil,calculate the thermal energy stored in oil per day.
When answering the parts (c) and (d) take the thermal
energy stored in oil per day as 5 x 10° J.
(c) It is planned to store this
heated oil in an insulated
tank so that it can be
used even during night. A
cubical tank, insulated with
two layers of materials of
thickness d. (inner) and 2
d, (outer) having thermal Figure (2)
conductivities k, and k, respectively is used for this
purpose (see figure 2]. Such a storage of thermal energy
is called a thermal battery.
(i) If the effective total surface area of cross-section
of the inner and outer insulation layers are A, and
A, respectively, write down expressions for the
rate of flow of heat through the insulation layers,
Zl, at the steady state in terms of d,, d,,k,, k,,
At
A,, A,,2,, 0, and ,, where 0, = temperature of the
oil; 0, = temperature at the interface between the
two layers; 0, = room temperature. Assume that the
tank is completely filled with oil and heat flow is
normal to the surfaces everywhere.
(ii) Find the thickness d, that the outer insulation layer
must have in order to limit the heat loss from oil to
the environment in a period of 10 hours to 1 % of
the total thermal energy stored per day. Perform
your calculation assuming that the temperature
of oil, remains at 0, = 330 °C during the 10 hour
period. Take k, = 0.2 J m K-1; k, = 0.03 J m K; A,
= 16 mº; A, = 17 m²; d =0.2m; 0,=30°C.
(iii) If the d, value calculated under the assumption in
part (c)(ii) above is used to construct the thermal
battery, will the heat loss from the battery be less
than or greater than the planned limit of 1 %?

(d) 25% of the thermal energy z
stored per day in the thermal
battery is to be used to
produce distilled water
by sending water at 30 °C
through a metallic spiral tube
dipped in the tank as shown
in figure (3) and producing
steam at 100 °C. The steam Figure (3)
is condensed using a heat exchanger. Calculate the
number of litres of distilled water that can be produced
per day if the efficiency of this process is 50%. Specific
latent heat of vaporization of water is 2.25 x 10 J kg.

Write down the expression for the Stefan-Boltzmann law
of blackbody radiation. Identify each quantity of the above
expression.
(a) (i) The Sun behaves like an idealized black body. The
distance from the Sun to the surface of the earth
is 1. 5 x 108 km. If the intensity of solar radiation
flux received on the earth from the Sun is 1000
W m2, find the temperature of the Sun's surface.
Neglect the temperature of the earth compared
to the surface temperature of the Sun. Take the
mean radius of the Sun as 7.0 x 105 km. Stefan -
Boltzmann constant is 5.67 x 10- W m2 K4.
(ii) Hence, calculate the wavelength of the peak
emission of radiation from the Sun at the above
temperature. The Wien's displacement constant is
2.9 x 10-3 mK.
(iii)A satellite orbiting the earth found that the more
accurate temperature of the surface of the Sun to be
5800 K. Explain briefly the reason for the deviation
of your answer from this value.
(b) The sunspots are irregularly shaped small dark regions
of the surface of the Sun. The dark centre of a sunspot
is known as the umbra and it emits 30% of radiation
compared to an equal area without sunspots on the
surface of the Sun.
(i) Assuming that a sunspot also behaves as an
idealized black body, calculate the temperature of
the umbra of a sunspot.
(ii) Calculate the shift in the wavelength of the peak
emission of radiation from the umbra compared to
the wavelength of peak emission of radiation from
the normal surface of the Sun.
(c) What changes in appearance would you expect to
observe in the Sun if the number of sunspots per
unit area of the Sun's surface increases significantly?

expansivity of lead by using a thin perforated lead
tube, closed at both ends. The temperature of the
tube is increased in steps by pumping hot air at
different temperatures. The temperature of the tube
is measured by means of a thermocouple. In this

8. Read the passage and answer the questions given
below.
Comets are small astronomical objects typically
moving in highly elliptical orbits around the Sun.
(see figure (1).] Some orbits cxtend roughly one
light-year beyond the planetary system. The main
force acting on the comet is the gravitational
attraction to the Sun. The main components of a
comet are the nucleus, coma and tails. While the
solid body of the comet, the nucleus, is generally
less than 50 km in extent, the conna inay he larger
than the Sun, and the tails can be extended over
150 million kilometers.
Miracle
Comets mainly, compose of frozen carbon dioxide,
methane, water (ice) with dust, and various types
of minerals. When the comet reaches the inner
planets and moving closer to the Sun, its outer
layer gets evaporated due to the radiation pressure
from the Sun. The dust and gases released from
it form the extended atmosphere of the comet
around its nucleus and is called the coma. The
solar radiation pressure and the solar wind acting
on the coma produce a bluish colour tail of ions
which is straight and directed away from the Sun
as the gas is more strongly affected by the solar
wind. The dust released from the comet forms
another white coloured and slightly curved tail
hehind the comet.
The speed of the comet varies from its minimum
value at the furthest point from the Sun (aphelion)
to the maximum value at the closest point to the
Sun (perihelion). For example, the Halley's coinet
of mass 2.0x1014 kg at the aphelion which is at a
distance of 5.0x1012 m from the Sun, acquires its
lowest speed of 12.0 kin si
Debris those enter the atmosphere from the outer
space are known as meteoroids. Most incteoroids
burn out emitting light in the atmosphere due
to heat generated through the friction with the
expense of their kinetic energies, both linear and
rotational. They are called meteors. when the
Earth's atmosphere crosses the debris left along
the path of a comet, meteor showers could be
observed. Some meteoroids fall onto the Earth's
surface and they are called meteorites.
When a meteoroid is rapidly reaching its melting
point, it becomes incandescent. when the
surrounding atoms become ionized and rapidly
recombined with the electrons causing the
emission of light, the meteoroid produces a huge
spherical air mass, appearing as a fire ball. Sonie
ineteoroids seen as fire balls could explode into
several pieces of meteors. Seconds after seeing
the explosion, the shock waves produced by
the fragınents of the meteoroid could reach the
ground making ground breaking sonic booms as
heard in the recent event in Russia.
(a) What are the main components of a comet?
(b) Write down three main differences between
the two types of tails of a cornet:
(c) Calculate the gravitational force acting on the
Halley's comet when it is at aphelion.
(Mass of the Sun = 2x100 kg, G=6.7x10" Nin4kg2) *
(d) Find the speed of the Halley's comet when it
is located at the perihelion where its distance
from the Sun is 8.0 x 1010 m.
Note : The velocity of the comet is
perpendicular to radial direction at both
perihelion and aphelion. Assume that the
mass remains unchanged.
(e) Why meteor showers are produced when
the Earth's atmosphere crosses an orbit of a
comet?
(f) What is the difference between meteors and
meteorites?
(g) What energies are converted to heat energy in
burning meteoroids?
(h) What is the mechanism that generates the
light for a meteoroid to appear as a fire ball?
(i) A meteoroid falling vertically downward
with a speed of 200 ms' explodes into two
pieces. If one piece having a inass 3/5 of the
meteoroid travels in the horizontal direction
with the speed of 600 ms? find the speed of
the other piece.

(A) The box P shown in the figure (1) comprises
a complex electrical circuit containing only

figure (2).

| drawn from the circuit in P when an
external resistance R, is connected across
the terminals XY in figure (2) in terms of E,
R and R,
Values of E and R mentioned above can
be determined experimentally by using
the two methods indicated under (b) and
(c) below

Use the results obtained above to write
down expressions for E and R
(c) In order to find values of E and R using
the second method, two resistors having
different values are used for R, in figure (2),
and the voltages V, across R, are measured
with a voltmeter having an extremely
high internal resistance compared to R,
values. Set of values obtained in such a
measurement is given below
When R, = Ik 12 V, = 75 mV

compared to R, show that the
current l in the circuit is almost
independent of the value of R, and
it depends only on E and R. You
may use the expression obtained
for l under part (a) above for this.

be treated as a constant current
source.)

to C, calculate the following
(i) Work done by air
(ii) The amount of heat given out from air.
(e) A process similar to the process shown in
figure (1) takes place in some vehicle engines.
The power output of an automobile engine is
directly proportional to the mass of air that
can be drawn into the engine to mix with a
given mass of fuel. These vehicles have a unit
called "turbocharger' which compresses the
air before it enters the engine, giving a greater
mass of air per unit volume. This rapid,
adiabatic compression heats the air. (Process
A to B shown in figure (1).] To compress.it
further, the air is then passed through a unit
called 'Intercooler' in which the air gives out
heat at constant pressure. [Process B to C
shown in figure (1). The air is then drawn into
the engine. Compared to the power output of
an engine that takes in air at a pressure 1.0
x 105 Pa at 27° C, what percentage increase
in power output can be obtained by using the
'turbocharger' and 'intercooler'? Hint; use

6. Read the following passage and answer the questions given below.
The Doppler effect for sound waves depends on three velocities, namely the velocities of sound, the source, and
the observer with respect to the air. Normally air is considered to be stationary relative to the ground and therefore
these velocities can be measured relative to the ground.
However, this is not the situation with regard to light waves. Light as well as other electromagnetic waves require
no medium, and they are capable of travelling even through a vacuum. The Doppler effect for light waves depends
on two velocities, namely the velocity of light (c) and the relative velocity (U) between the source and the observer,
as measured from the reference frame of either source or the observer.
If a certain light source is at rest relative to us, we would detect light from it with the same frequency (.) as that
of the source, and it is known as the proper frequency. If it is moving away from us with a speed v (v << c), then
the light we detect has a frequency f that is shifted from f, due to the Doppler effect and f is given by the following
formula.
f = fp(1-B) where B =
However, measurements involving light are usually made in wavelengths rather than frequencies, and the above
formula can be rewritten in terms of wavelengths in the following form.
v=qc where si=1-ho
Core of M87
The quantity Al is called the Doppler shift.
If the light source is moving away from us, a is longer than do, Az is positive, and the
Doppler shift is called a red shift. If the light source is moving toward us, then 2 is
shorter than 2, Al is negative, and the Doppler shift is called a blue shift.
Figure (1)
Using astronomical observations of stars, galaxies and other sources of light, scientists
can determine how fast the sources are moving, either directly
away from us or directly towards us by measuring the Doppler -2
shift of the light that reaches us.
Two regions of interstellar gas orbiting the core of a galaxy known
as M87 at a radius r = 100 light years is shown in figure (1).
One region is moving towards us with a speed u and and the
other region is moving away from us with the same speed. Figure
(2) shows the variation of intensity (1) with wavelength (2) of
light reaching us from those two regions.
The gas is under the influence of the gravitational force due to the
499 500 501 502 503 504
mass M of the core of the galaxy. This mass of the core is about
Figure (2)
two billion times the mass of our sun, strongly suggesting that a
super massive black hole occupies the core.
(a) (i) Doppler effect for sound waves depends on three velocities. Name them.
(ii) These velocities are normally measured relative to the ground. What is the reason for this?
(6) Why does the Doppler effect for light depends only on two velocities?
Λ

10. Answer either part (A) or part (B) only.
: (A) (a) Consider a pond of cross section 2 in x 2 m, and containing pure water constantly being exposed to direct
sunlight. (see figure 1) The amount of solar heat radiation falling on the pond is 1000 W m-2 and
assume that it is constant for the calculations below.
Furthermore assume that solar heat is incident normal to the water surface at all times, no heat transfer
occurs between water and the walls of the pond and that no heat is absorbed by water directly
from sunlight. All the heat is absorbed by a blackened metal sheet placed at the bottom of the pond
and then transferred to water near the bottom by conduction.
(i) If the amount of heat absorbed by the metal sheet over a 7 minute period entirely contributed to raise
the temperature of a thin layer of water of mass 40 kg just above the metal sheer, how much will
be the temperature rise in water? (Take specific heat capacity of water as 4200 J kg-'K)
(ii) Let densities of water at 0°C and at 0°C be pe and pe
respectively. Obtain an expression for p in terms of po, 8 and
the volume expansivity of water y.

(iii) Explain why convection currents will occur when water is
heated as mentioned in (a) (i) above.

(b) A solar pond is a pond used to collect and store solar energy as heat. Solar heat
reaching the bottom of such a pond is trapped by suppressing convection currents.
A very simple model of a solar pond with a 2 mx 2 m area is shown in figure (2).
It has three distinct layers. The top layer has relatively pure water. The bottom
layer has a very high salt concentration resulting a high density. The density is MINI |||
uniform throughout that layer. In the middle layer, the salt concentration and Figurc (2)
density decreases gradually with height.
For the following parts, assume that the initial temperature of water throughout the pond is 30 °C.
(i) In a practical solar pond, the temperature of the bottom layer can reach about 90 °C. If the mass
of water in this layer is 6000 kg and if it receives heat radiation at the constant rate of
1000 W m-, how long will water take to reach 90 °C? Assume that this heat is entirely used
to increase the temperature of water, and that salt water has the same specific heat capacity as
pure water.
(ii) Taking p = 1554 kg m-3 for salt water, calculate the density of salt water at 90 °C. (Volume
expansivity of salt water is 4 x 10-4 K-')
(iii) If the top layer remains at 30 °C, can there be convection currents from the bottom to the top
layer under the above condition? Justify your answer. (Take density of pure water at 30 °C as
1000 kg m.)
(iv) (1) When the temperature of the bottom layer increase from 30 °C to 90 °C, calculate the amount
of heat stored in that layer.
(2) Suggest a method to use this energy for a practical purpose.
(v) In a practical solar pond, heat loss through the walls must be minimised. If a styrofoam layer
of thickness 10 cm is used as an insulation between water and walls of the pond, and if the
temperature of the walls stays at 40°C while water is at 90 °C, what will be the rate of heat
loss per m² through styrofoam? (Heat conductivity of styrofoam is 0.01 W m-'K-'.)

2. The material called Styrofoam, Rigifoam or polystyrene is widely used for making disposable cups. The
thermal conductivity of this material is less than 0.0001 times that of copper while its specific heat capacity
is about 4 times that of copper.
In order to investigate the suitability of using a styrofoam cup instead of a copper calorimeter in heat
experiments, a student selected the "experiment of determination of specific heat capacity of iron in the
form of iron balls using method of mixtures", and arranged two experimental setups to perform the
experiment, one using a copper calorimeter and the other using a Styrofoam cup. The figure shows his

5. A capsule which is free to move through a vertical cylindrical tube as shown in figure can be used
to rescue a person trapped in an underground mine. A wire, one end of which is fixed to a pulley of
radius R, and wrapped around the pulley, is used to hang the capsule. Assume that the mass of the
wire and the friction between the wire and the pulley are negligible. The pulley is free to rotate
about a horizontal axle. Answers to the following questions should consist of only relevant
quantities represented by the given symbols. (g = gravitational acceleration)
(a) For this part assume that the mass of the pulley and the frictional force against the rotational
motion of the pulley are negligible.
(i) If the capsule of total mass M is released from rest, use the law of conservation of
energy to obtain an expression for the speed of the capsule after it has moved down
a depth h.
(ii) Find the angular speed of the pulley after the capsule has moved down the depth h.
(b) If the mass m of the pulley is not negligible and the moment of inertia of the pulley about
the rotating axis is mR, repeat parts (a) (i) and (a) (ii) neglecting the frictional forces.
(c) Under practical situations the mass m of the pulley and the friction against the rotational motion are not
negligible. Assume that the friction exerts a constant frictional torque, tr, against the rotational motion of
the pulley.
(i) What is the work done against the frictional torque' (Tp), when the pulley has rotated by an angle
in radians?
(ii) Answer parts (a) (i) and (a) (ii) under these conditions.
(iii) After moving down a depth h, the capsule reaches the bottom of the tube and stops. However, the
pulley keeps rotating against the frictional torque. Use the law of conservation of energy to find the
number of turns (n) that the pulley would rotate further after the capsule has stopped.
(d) A person of mass m, gets into the capsule when it is at the bottom of the tube. Find the external torque
(5.) that must be applied on the pulley to rotate it at a constant angular speed while raising the capsule.
Assume the conditions given in part (c) for this.

6. Figure (1) shows a zoom lens arrangement used in a camera. It _P
consists of a convex lens of focal length f, and a concave lens of focal li
i TT
length f, separated by a variable distance d. The purpose of a zoom
lens is to vary the effective focal length of the lens combination
significantly with a small variation of d thereby providing variable
magnification of the object.

(a) What is the inequality that should be satisfied by d and f, in order to form a real image at I?
(b) The lens combination forms an image 1 at a distance V to the right of the concave lens. Derive an expression
for V in terms of fir fy and d.

a parallel ray incident on the convex lens at a distance r..from
the principal axis. Show that the distance r from the optical axis
to this ray at the point it enters the concave lens is given by

minimum and maximum focal lengths of the combination.

7. (a) A capillary tube of internal radius r is immersed vertically in water under atmospheric pressure. Show that
the value of the capillary rise h in the tube is given by h= or where T is the surface tension of water
and p is the density of water. Take the contact angle between water and the material of the tube to be
zero.
(b) In plants, water ascends through capillaries known as xylem tubes. When answering parts (b) (i) and (b) (ii)
consider a xylem tube having both ends open to atmospheric pressure.
(i) Calculate the height to which water rises in such a capillary of radius 100 um. (Surface tension of
water = 7.2 x 102 N m-, density of water = 103 kg m-3)
(ii) Water rises up to a height of even 100 m in tall trees. If water goes up the xylem tubes due to capillary
action alone, calculate the internal radius of a capillary that would raise water by 100 m to the top
of a tree.
(c) However scientists have never found such small capillaries calculated in (b) (ii) above in tree xylem. Therefore
capillary action cannot be solely responsible for water getting to the top of trees.
To explain how water ascends from roots to leaves, scientists use the concept known as the water pressure
(water potential per unit volume). At standard temperature and pressure, pure water is given a water pressure
of zero. Adding solute molecules to the water has the effect of lowering the water pressure, i.e. making
it negative. When water evaporates from leaf tissues it raises the solute concentration of water in leaves.
This results the water pressure of leaves to be relatively low compared with the
water pressure at roots. This water pressure gradient pushes the water up from
leaf
roots to leaves.
(i) The figure shows a root and a leaf of a tree. If the water pressures of the 6103
root and the leaf are -102 kPa and -103 kPa respectively, estimate the height
of the water column that can be sustained by this pressure difference. Neglect
the surface tension of water.
(d)
root
(i) Assuming the water flow in the xylem tube (internal radius = 100 um) to
be streamlined, use the Poiseuille's' equation to determine the average speed
of rising water. Neglect the weight of the rising water column. Viscosity of
water = 10-3 Pa s. Take the length of the xylem tube to be equal to the height
calculated in (c) (i) above.
(ii) Calculate the power needed to raise this water column up in the xylem tube.
(Take it = 3)

8. Use of satellites is expanding due to many applications in areas such as communication, meteorology, defence
and scientific exploration about the earth as well as the outer space. Satellites are placed on certain orbits depending
on their applications. The gravitational force provides the required centripetal force to maintain a satellite in
an orbit.
Geosynchronous satellites orbit the earth with a period of 24 hours, thus matching the period of the earth's
rotational motion. A geostationary satellite (GSS) is a Geosynchronous satellite in an approximately circular
orbit on the plane passing through the earth's equator (0° latitude) that appears motionless in the sky, to a ground
***
– Phys./NS/11/18
-19-
observer. The idea of a GSS was first proposed by the science friction writer Arthur C. Clarke. Communication
satellite and weather satellites are often given Geostationary orbits as they can continuosly observe the same
areas on the earth. GSS use directional antennas for communication with ground stations. There are also several
disadvantages of a satellite being operated as a GSS. The number of satellites that can be maintained in
Geostationary orbits without interfering one another is limited. An electromagnetic (EM) signal emitted from
a ground station, travels at the speed of light (3 x 108 ms"'). Due to the great distance to the satellite a significant
time delay is introduced between the original signal emitted from an earth station and the signal received by
another station after travelling via a satellite. Furthermore, due to the greater height, the clarity of pictures of
the earth taken by GSS are poor, especially at locations away from the equator. Another problem would be
the damage caused by the EM radiation from the sun when a GSS comes closer to the sun especially when
the sun passes through the equatorial plane at late March and late September.
Low Earth Orbit Satellites (LEOS), typically operating at the heights of 160-2000 km from the surface of
the earth with shorter periods, have become popular in recent years. Their orbits could be on any plane passing
through the centre of the earth. However, for continuous data acquisition pertaining to a specific location (eg:
observation of weather over a given country) a system of a group of LEOS is needed. Some advantages of
a LEOS are the use of simple non-directional antennas, reduced time delay for EM signals, higher clarity pictures
of the earth and less EM radiation from the sun. Also, it needs less energy and resources to place a satellite
into a Low Earth Orbit and need less powerful amplifiers for successful communication. A polar satellite which
passes over the poles of the earth is a special case of LEOS. Hubble space telescope is another example of
LEOS.
For scientific exploration of outer space, experiments are conducted in observatories placed on the orbits which
are far away from the earth. There are five specific locations called Lagrange points or L-Points where satellites
could be placed to perform such experiments. Satellites placed at L-points appear stationary relative to the Sun-
Earth system. The following figure shows two of the L-points called L, and L. When the earth orbits the sun
with a period of 1 year, satellites placed at L, and L, also move with the Sun-Earth system but the relative
locations of them remain the same. There are four satellites at the vicinity of L, and three satellites including
the latest Planck Space Observatory have been placed at the vicinity of Ly. L, is especially useful for observation
of outer space because, the earth partially blocks solar radiation falling towards the satellite at L, throughout
the motion. (Radius of the earth is 6.4 x 10ºm).
(a) What is the value of the period of a GSS?
(6) Draw a 3-dimensional diagram of the orbit of a GSS around the earth. Clearly indicate
the geometrical North, South and the equatorial plane of the earth.
(c) Give an example for a LEOS.
(d) Obtain an expression for the radius r of a GSS in terms of universal gravitational constant G, mass of
the earth M, and the period T of GSS. Substitute the correct numerical values in the expression
GM, = 40 X 1013 mºs-2. No need to simply the answer.

10. Answer either part (A) or part (B) only.
(A) A closed transparent chamber of volume 1 m3 contains air at 30 °C and 80% relative humidity. Air inside
the chamber is first dried by means of an equipment (dehumidifier) which removes moisture without changing
its temperature so that the absolute humidity of the air is dropped to 50% of its initial value. Absolute
humidity of air saturated with water vapour at 30 °C is 30 g m-.
(a) Calculate the absolute humidity of dried air.
The dehumidifier is then removed and the chamber with dried air is used to study the drying of paddy.
For this, 750 g of wet paddy is introduced into the chamber at time t = 0. The initial moisture content
of the paddy sample amounts to 20% of its initial mass. Paddy sample is kept on the pan of an electronic
balance placed inside the chamber and its mass can be read from outside.
(b) Find the mass of the moisture present in the given paddy sample before placing it in the chamber.
(c) As the paddy dries, the variation of its mass (M) with time (1) as displayed by the electronic balance
is shown in the figure.
MA
(i) Give a reason
(1) for the shape of the curve,
(2) as to why the mass attains a equilibrium value M, after some time.
. (ii) What is the relative humidity of air inside the chamber when the mass met
of paddy reaches M ?
(iii) Calculate the equillibrium mass M.
(iv) Calculate the remaining moisture content in grammes of the paddy sample when its mass
becomes M
*
**
- Phys./NS/11/21
-22-
(d) If the percentage moisture content of the paddy sample is to be reduced to 10% what should be the
minimum volume of the chamber that has to be employed with dried air prepared in the same manner
as given at the beginning of this question?
(e) Atmospheric air heated to higher temperature (without using a dehumidifier) can also be used for drying.
If the closed chamber of 1 m is filled with air which was originally at 30 °C and relative humidity 80%
now heated to 70 °C to perform this study calculate
(i) the initial relative humidity of heated air inside the chamber before introducing the paddy sample.
(ii) expected value of M.
Assume that the temperature of air inside the chamber is maintained at 70 °C throughout the time
of the study. Absolute humidity of air at 70 °C saturated with water vapour is 216 g m .
(B) In the medical imaging technique called Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a patient is injected with
a radioactive isotope that decays by emitting positrons (B+ or et) to a blood vessel. Next, the radiation
coming out of the body is detected by detectors placed around the patient. Using this information, an image
is constructed by a computer, which shows the concentration of that isotope in different regions of the
body.
Suppose a patient is injected with 20 pico grams of 150-water (water prepared by replacing 160 atoms by 150
atoms). 150 atoms decay by emitting positrons with a half life (T; of 2 minutes. (1 pico gram = 10-12 gram.)
(a) (i) The activity of a radioactive sample that has an N number of atoms is given by the formula
0.7N
A = 0;IN. Calculate the activity (in Bg) of the amount of 150- water injected, at the time of
Tv
injection. (Take the mass of one 150-water molecule as 2.8 x 10-26 kg).
(ii) Calculate the activity (in Bq) inside the brain due to 150 decay, after 2 minutes of the injection,
Assume that 10% of the injected water reached the brain of the patient during that period.
(iii) Due to the naturally present radioactive isotopes (such as 14C) in the body, there is an activity
of about 104 Bq in the body of a normal person. Show that, 40 minutes after giving the above
injection, the activity due to 150 decay in the body of the patient will become less than the naturally
present activity. (Take 220 = 106)
(iv) What could be the advantage of using an isotope with a very short half-life?
(b) Inside the body, the positrons emitted by the decaying 150 atoms interact with electrons in the body
to produce two gamma rays according to the reaction et + e + 2y. These gamma rays can be detected
by detectors placed outside the body.
(i) If an electron (B) emitting isotope is used instead of a positron (B+) emitting isotope, explain
why no radiation will come out of the body of the patient.
(ii) If a gamma ray has an energy E, the magnitude p of its momentum is given by p = Elc where
c is the speed of light. Using the law of conservation of momentum, show that both gamma rays
in the above reaction must have the same energy and that they will be travelling in opposite
directions. (assume that both et and é have zero momentum.)
(iii) Both et and e have the same mass. In energy units, this mass is 511 keV. How much is the energy
of one gamma ray in the above reaction?
(c) The maximum dose of radiation a patient could get from an 150-water injection can be estimated by
assuming that all the gamma rays produced are absorbed by the body of the patient. If the weight of the
patient mentioned above is 51.1 kg, calculate this maximum dose. (average over the body) he could
receive from the injection of 20 pico gram 10-water, in Gy. (1.keV= 1.6 x 10-16J and 1 Gy=1J kg-1)

This is a LEOS. Because
• it is in an inclined plane.
• the height is in the range of 160 - 2000 km
• period is less than 24 hours.
(g) Three advantages of LEOS
• Possibility of using of simple non-directional antennas.
• Reduced time delay for EM signals.
• Higher clarity pictures of the earth.
• Less exposure to EM radiation from the Sun.
• Less energy and resources to place the satellite into a LEO.
• Need less powerful amplifiers.
(h) L, is better because at this location the earth partially blocks solar radiation falling on the
satellite.

M.
(1) Reason for the shape of the curve
Rate of decrease of M with t gradually becomes smaller as the air
becomes more and more humid due to evaporation of mositure from the
paddy, and therefore the rate of evaporation decreases with time.
(2) Finally M attains a constant value because air becomes saturated with
water vapour (OR RH becomes 100%) and no further evaporation is
possible.
(ii) RH = 100%

(d) In order to reduce moisture content of paddy sample to 10% the amount of
moisture that has to be removed from paddy is *
OR 75 g
Since each 1 m’ of dry air can absorb 18 g of moisture from paddy, the minimum

Therefore, the directions will be opposite.
Because the magnitudes of the momenta are equal, the energies will be equal.

1. A uniform rod, AB, of square cross section, mass M and length L rests on a horizontal
frictionless surface as shown in figure 1. The moment of inertia of the rod about an axis
perpendicular to the surface and passing through its centre of gravity, G is I.
The rod is struck by a ball of mass m travelling along the surface without spinning,
with a velocity v perpendicular to the rod. The motion of the rod due to the impact
of the ball can be studied in terms of the linear motion of the centre of gravity of
the rod and the rotation about its centre of gravity. Assume that the rod does not topple. Hon

impact.

2. Read the following passage and answer the questions below.
Activities used in construction such as blasting generate ground vibration. If its amplitudes are sufficiently
large, ground vibration has the capability of damaging structures such as buildings, monuments and ruins, cause
cosmetic damage such as cracking of plaster, or disrupt the operation of vibration sensitive equipment such as
electron microscopes. Pile driving using pile drivers, demolition activity and blasting are some of the primary
sources of vibration, Traffic, including heavy trucks traveling on a highways which are in good condition rarely
generates vibration amplitudes high enough to cause structural or cosmetic damage. However, there have been cases
in which heavy trucks traveling over potholes or other discontinuties on the road have caused vibrations high
enough to result in complaints from nearby residents. In describing vibrations in the ground and in structures, the
motion of a particle (i.e, a point in or on the ground or structure) is used. The concept of particle displacement,
velocity, and acceleration are used to describe how the ground or structure respond to excitation. Although
displacement is generally, easier to understand than velocity or acceleration, it is rarely used to describe ground and
structurebome vibration because most transducers used to measure vibration directly measure velocity or
acceleration, not displacement. Accordingly vibratory motion is commonly described by identifying the Peak
Particle Velocity (PPV) or Peak Particle Acceleration (PPA). PPV is generally accepted as the most appropriate
descriptor for evaluating the potential for building damage. To determine human response, however, an average of
vibration amplitudes is more appropriate because it takes time for the human body to respond to the excitation (the
human body respond to an average of vibration amplitudes, not a peak amplitude). However as the average particle
velocity over time is zero, the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) of the velocity amplitude is typically used to assess human
response. Displacement is generally measured in millimeters (mm). Velocity is measured in mm s-.
One of the methods to assess the potential to damage structures by vibration is to estimate or predict the
PPV from various sources at various distances. One such vibratory source is a vibratory pile driver. Pile driving
has potential to damage surface and buried structures even at greater distances. Vibratory pile driver is a machine
that installs piling into the ground by applying an alternating force. This force is generally generated by a pair
of identical eccentric weights rotating about shafts. The figure shows the basic setup for the rotating eccentric
weights used in modern vibratory pile equipment. Each rotating weights produces a force acting in a single
plane and directed toward the axis of the shaft. However, when a pair of identical eccentric weights are used
the resultant force F will act along ty direction.
Vibration amplitudes produced by vibrating pile drivers can be estimated by the following equation.

PPV =
- Ref | Erer
where PPVer represents PPV value for a reference pile -
driver at 10 m from the driver

3. (a) Radii of water droplets in low-lying rain clouds is in the range of 10 um to 60 um. Under certain conditions
smaller water droplets coalesce to form larger water drops and these water drops are released from clouds
as rain. How many water droplets, each having a radius of 10 um, must coalesce to form a water droplet
of radius 40 um?
(b) When a water drop is falling through air, a drag force is acting on the drop, in addition to the other two forces,
weight and the upthrust. Only if the radius of the water droplet is less than 50 pm, the water droplet retains
its spherical shape and the drag force is due to the viscosity of air which is given by Stokes' law. Consider
a water droplet of radius 40 um, released from a rain cloud located at an altitude of 2 km.
(i) Assuming that the air remains at rest and the upthrust on the water droplet can be neglected, calculate
the terminal velocity (0) of the water droplet of radius 40 um.
(Viscosity of air = 1.6 x 10-5. Pas, Density of water = Pw = 109 kg m-3)
(ii) It has been found that, in general, a water droplet of radius 40 um would evaporate completely within
a period of 600 s. As the radius of this droplet decreases due to evaporation, the terminal velocity also
decreases, and the mean velocity of the droplet for its entire motion can be considered to be
Show that this water droplet will evaporate completely before reaching the ground.
(c) When the radius of the raindrop is larger (greater than about 100 um) the shape of the raindrop tends to
deviate appreciably from spherical shape. Now, consider a raindrop which has a vertical length h> 100 um)
and is falling vertically through air at a constant speed. Assume that the atmospheric pressure (II) and the
density of air remain constant. Take the radius of curvature of the drop as R, at the upper end of the drop
and R, at the lower end.
(1) If the pressure at a point just below the upper end of the water drop is P: (> II), write down an
expression for (P, - I in terms of R, and the surface tension of water (7).
(ii) What is the pressure at a point just above the lower end of the raindrop? Express your answer in
terms of Pi, h, the density of water (Pw) and acceleration due to gravity &. .
(iii) Show that R, > R2:
(iv) Calculate the value of (R4-R) for a raindrop of vertical length h = 4 mm. Take R, R2 = 4 x 100 m2
for this case. Surface tension of water is 7.5 x 10-2 N m-!
(d) When the maximum hydrostatic pressure inside the raindrop becomes greater than the pressure difference
due to surface tension at the lower surface of the raindrop, the raindrop becomes unstable and breaks into
smaller 'droplets. Assuming h = 2R,, calculate the maximum value of vertical length hmer, a raindrop call

(a) In the circuit shown in figure 1, A and B are two identical light dependent
resistors (LDR). The resistance of each LDR at complete darkness is 50 M2.
The operational amplifier has saturation voltages of #5 V and an open loop
voltage gain of 10%.
(i) Calculate the minimum voltage difference between P and that would
saturate the operational amplifier at +5 V.

(ii) What would be the voltage V, at X when both LDRs are at complete
darkness?

the resistance of each LDR to drop to 200 12, what would be the value of V,?
(iv) When both LDRs are kept in the place mentioned in (iii) above, light from a small light source
is allowed to fall on A only. This reduces the resistance of A to 50 12. Calculate the new VX
value.
(v) If this circuit is used for detecting an external light source, is there an advantage of using an
LDR for B, without using of a fixed resistor? Explain the reason for your answer.

of cardboard with a hole, placed near the two LDRs. S is on
a light source. The cardboard is moved slowly at a constant
speed starting from position (1) until it reaches position (3)
via position (2). The resistance of A when it receives light 40 • 10 • 10 •
through the hole is 50 12. At other positions, due to ambient
light, its resistance is 200 12. Resistance of B remains at

a robot is based on the above principle. Figure 3 shows a robot arm that moves back and forth and
a metal plate with two rows of holes, attached to it. The metal plate is moving between light sources
and LDRs as shown in the figure. The two LDRs B and B (not shown in the figure) are kept away
from the light sources and they only receive the same ambient light as A and A'. The two LDRs
A and B are connected to the circuit shown in figure 1 while LDRs A'and B connected to another

electromagnetic spectrum of the Sun, incident on the Earth. The two
monochromatic light beams corresponding to the two frequencies are light beam
obtained using filters. Each beam has a cross-sectional area of

1. Write down Bernoulli's equation and identify each term.
An ancient waterway which supplies water to a

Stage 1: A rectangular horizontal open water

Slage 1
outlet of a large reservoir at a depth i
0.5 m
from the water level.
Stage 2
Stage 2: Another rectangular open wüter channel
having same floor width as in stage 1
but runs with a slope as shown in figure.
Width of the channel floor in stages 1
Stage 3
and 2 is 0.5 m.
Stage 3: The stage 3 linked to the stage 2 is an
open horizontal shallow channel of 1 A
rectangular cross-section with much
broader floor width, d, of 10 m. Water
coming from stage 2 enters this channel
and starts to flow in orthogonal direction
as shown in figure creating a waterfall
which provides water to the pond below.
(a) At the steady state waterfall carries 1.5 m of
water per second. If the speed of water flow at
the exit X of the stage 2 is 10 ms, calculate
the height of the water level of the channel of
stage 2 at X.
(b) Assuming that the height of the water level of
the shallow channel of stage 3 is equal to the height of the water level of the stage 2 at X, calculate the
speed with which water flows through the shallow channel.
(c) If the speed of the water flow at the horizontal channel of stage 1 is 5 ms, calculate the height of the
water level of the open channel of siage 1.
(d) Considering a stream line along the top surface of the water flow calculate the height (1) from channel
floor of stage 2 at X to channel floor of stage 1 (see the figure). You may assume that the water leaves
to the atmosphere of atmospheric pressure F at the outlet of the reservoir, and water enters thic shallow
channel at X which is also at pressure P.
(e) Calculate the height h of the water level in the reservoir that has to be maintained for this purposc.
6) If the water level of the reservoir exceeds the value calculated in (e), propose a method to regulate water
flow so that the waterfall carries the same amount of water per second, mentioned in (a).

(ii) Write down an expression for the angle of deviation of the ray AP due to the reflection at P in terms of r.
(iii) Write down an expression for the angle of deviation of the ray PC due to the refraction at C in terms
of i and r.
(iv) Hence, write down an expression for the total angle of deviation (D) of
the emergent ray relative to the incident ray in terms of i and r.
A rainbow can be seen due to the emergence of incident sunlight from
raindrops. Since sunlight consists of all visible colours, when white light
refracts at A it separates into its colours. Figure (2) shows such a refracted
red colour ray (R) and blue colour ray (B).
(d) Copy the figure (2) onto your answer sheet and complete the subsequent paths of the red and blue rays.
(e) The expression obtained in (c) (iv) above shows that D varies with i. It has been found that when
i = 52°, the blue rays emerge from the raindrop with the angle of minimum deviation.
(i) Determine the corresponding angle of minimum deviation D min for blue rays.
(sin 52° = 0.788, sin 36.25º = 0.591, Take the refractive index of water for blue colour also to be -).
(ii) Assuming i = 52° in your ray diagram drawn in (d) above, mark D min
The light of any colour that emerges from the rain drop with the angle of minimum deviation
corresponding to that colour is especially bright as rays bunch up at that angle. These bright colour
bands which are deviated with minimum angles of deviation enter the eyes of an observer on the
ground, and thereby a rainbow is seen.
(iii) Determine the angle made by the blue colour of the rainbow with the horizontal relative to the observer
on the ground.
(iv) Which colour forms the outer edge of the rainbow?

6. Answer either part (A) or part (B) only. .
(A) An electric kettle as shown in the figure contains
0.8 kg of water at 20 °C. A person switchea ON this
kettle and left the water in it to boil. He however,
has forgotten to switched OFF the kettle in time, and
finally when he switched it OFF only 50% of water
was found to be left in the kettle at its boiling
temperature of 100 °C. The heater H in the kettle is
rated as 2025 W. Assume during the heating process
only 80% of the heat produced by the heater goes to
heating of water.
(a) (i) Calculate the amount of heat that is produced by the heater H before the kettle is switched OFF.
(ii) How long the kettle would have been in the ON position? Give your answer to the nearest minute.
(iii) At what rate the boiling water would have evaporated? Give your answer in kg s-.
(iv.) Assuming that the water vapour in the kettle behaves like an ideal gas, write down an expression
for its density p in terms of pressure P of the vapour, gas constant R, temperature T of the vapour
and molar mass of the water M.
(v) If the spout s of the kettle has a cross-sectional area of 3.73 x 104 m², using the result of part
(iii) above and the expression from part (iv) above, calculate the speed u with which the water
vapour would have escaped from the spoui of the kettle.
Assume that the water vapour could escape only through the spout of the kettle and the pressure
of water vapour in the kettig is at the atmospheric pressure of 10-N m2.
Specific heat capacity of water is 4200 kg- k-';
Specific latent heat of vaporization of water is 2.25 x 100 J kg-?;
Gas constant R = 8.3 J mol-' K-l; Molar mass M of the water = 0.018 kg mol-'
(6) Once the water in the kettle has reached the temperature of 95 °C, 200 cm of water is poured into
a glass cup which is initially at 25°C. The mass of the cup is 250 g. Calculate the maximum temperature
attained by the cup of water. Assime that there is no heat loss to the surroundings. Take the specific
heat capacity of glass as 840 J kg K and density of water as 100 kg my.
(B) Read the following passage and answer the questions given below.
The Sun which provides the energy necessary to sustain all forms of life on the earth, is a star in our
Galaxy. At present, the Sun contains about 74% hydrogen and 24% helium by mass and remaining 2%
nakes up some of the heavier elements. All these elements are in a completely ionized gaseous state, also
known as a plasma state. The pirotssphere is the lowest of the three layers comprising the Sun's atmosphere
and has a blackbody spectrum. Most of the visible light from the Sun comes from this photosphere which
has a relatively small thickness. Immediately above the photosphere is a dim layer of less dense gas called
the chromosphere. The outermost region of the Sun's'atmosphere, the corona, extends several million
kilometres from the chromosphere. Because the corona is the farthest region in the Sun's atmosphere from
-

the surface of the Sun, it is expected that the temperature in that region to be the lowest. But it has been
found that the highest temperature of the Sun's atmosphere which is around 1.5 x 10° K, is in the coronal
region. Astrophysicists have suggested that this unexpected rise in temperature of the corona is due to the
release of energy carried from the interior of the Sur: by complex magnetic fields that exist in the Sun.
Region below the photosphere is considered to be the ir.terior of the Sun and has a radius of R. = 7x108 m,
which is also considered as the solar radius, and a mass Mo = 2 x 1030 kg. The region closer to the centre of
the Sun where the temperature and pressure are very high is known as the core. Because of very high
temperature and pressure fusion of hyurogen nuclei takes place at the core of the Sun. This hydrogen fusion
reaction can be written as follows;
4H - He + 2et + neutrinos + energy
The generated energy travels to the surface of the Sun and is released from there. When answering the
following questions take Wien's constant to be 3 x 10-3 m K.
(u) What is meant by the plasma state of matter?
(b) What are the three regions exist in the Sun's atmosphere?
(c) Which region of the Sun's atmosphere has the highest temperature? Give a reason for that regior
to have the highest temperature?
(d) Calculate the wavelength associated with the maximum intensity of the radiation emitted from the corona.
To which region of electromagnetic spectrum does this radiation belong?
(c) If the wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity of the light emitted from the photosphere
is 500 nm, what is the temperature of the photosphere (i.e. the temperature of the surface of the Sun).
() Find the energy, Lo, released from the surface of the Sun per second which is also known as the
solar luminosity. Take the Stefan constant as o = 6x10-8Wm-K-4, and the emissivity of the solar
surface as 1.
(8) (i) If the mass of a hydrogen nucleus is 1.67x10-27 kg and mass, of a helium nucleus is 6.65 x 10-27 kg,
calculate the mass difference (Am) between four hydrogen nuclei and one helium nucleus. Hence
calculate the energy released in a single fusion reaction using AE=(Am)c. Here c=3x1ms-.
Assume that the positrons and neutrinos have negligible masses,
(ii) Assuming that the energy released at the core of the Sun entirely contributes to the solar luminosity
that you have obtained in () above, calculate the number of the hydrogen nuclei, which is converted
into helium within its core each second.
(iii) If it is assumed that hydrogen is converted into helium at the present rate, how long will it take
to convert entire mass of hydrogen inside the Sun into helium? [For this part of the question
take the mass of a hydrogen nucleus as 2 x 10-27 kg.)
